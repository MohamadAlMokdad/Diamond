# 🎇 Pyramid and Inverted Pyramid Pattern Generator

This Python program prompts the user to enter the number of rows (`num_rows`) and generates a **pyramid** followed by an **inverted pyramid** pattern using asterisks (`*`). This program is great for understanding nested loops and pattern generation! 🔺🔻

## 📋 Example Output

For example, if you enter `num_rows = 5`, the output will be:

    *
   ***
  *****
 *******
*********
 *******
  *****
   ***
    *
